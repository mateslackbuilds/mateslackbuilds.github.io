         <!-- Begin Content -->
         <div id="content">
           <p>These SlackBuilds are intended to provide a means for a user to
           build and install the <a href="https://www.mate-desktop.org">MATE Desktop
             Environment</a> on <a
             href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware Linux</a>.  Some of the goals
           of the project are:</p>
           <ol>
             <li>Do not replace any stock Slackware packages unless
             absolutely necessary (thus far, no packages need to be replaced);</li>
             <li>Keep the upstream default theme and settings;</li>
             <li>Try and minimize outside dependencies as much as possible;
             and</li>
             <li>Make it easy to build and install by using standard style
             SlackBuild scripts and slack-desc and doinst.sh files that most
             Slackware users have become familiar with by using the <a
               href="https://www.slackbuilds.org">SlackBuilds</a> repository.</li></ol>
           <p>The scripts are hosted in a <a
             href="https://github.com/mateslackbuilds/msb">Github</a> and 
	   <a href="https://gitlab.com/mateslackbuilds/msb">Gitlab</a> so feel
           free to test and offer suggestions, improvements, patches, etc.
           Here are some obligatory screenshots of MATE 1.18 with its default
           theme and background running on Slackware64-14.2:</p>

           <p>FAQ:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>Q: Are there binary packages?</li><li>A: Yes, there are
             packages for Slackware 14.2 x86 and x86_64 available at:
             <a
               href="https://slackware.uk/msb">http://slackware.uk/msb</a>.  It is still advisable to
             clone the git repo and build the packages yourself but these
             packages are available for your convenience.</li>
           <li>Q: Why i don't see MATE 1.22 or newer binary packages for Slackware 14.2?</li>
           <li>A: MATE 1.22 and newer requires newer GTK+3 library that isn't available on Slackware 14.2,
           so MATE 1.18 is the last release that can be installed on top of Slackware 14.2. See our
           <a href="support.html">Supported Releases</a> page.</li>
           <li>Q: How do i manage binary packages automatically?</li>
	   <li>A: You can use <a href="http://slakfinder.org/slackpkg+.html">slackpkg+</a>
	   to manage binary packages. Please see
           <a href="http://slakfinder.org/slackpkg+/src/repositories.txt">supported repositories</a>.</li>
	   <li>Q: Is it possible to try out MATE in a live session for trial?</li>
	   <li>A: Please have a look on <a href="https://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/slackware-live/">
	   AlienBOB's Slackware Live</a> project that includes MATE Desktop.</li>
           <li>Q: Do the scripts build and run on -current?</li><li>A: Yes,
           based on our testing. These scripts are developed on
           Slackware-current machines but binary packages will target for stable releases.
	   Please be sure to read the README.TXT, KNOWN_ISSUES.TXT, and CURRENT.TXT
	   documents as these are updated to note any potential problems or issues.</li>
           <li>Q: So -current is officially supported?</li>
           <li>A: Not exactly.  Since Slackware -current is a moving target,
           there is no guarantee that MATE SlackBuilds will build or work properly
           on Slackware -current.  Only a full installation of the latest
           Slackware release is officially supported. <br/>
	   We do however tried to support -current as much as we can. Please use master
	   branch for testing with -current.</li>
           <li>Q: I'm getting weird issues with the panel, menu, icons, or
           other such things.  What's up?</li>
           <li>A: This is rare, but if it happens, check the KNOWN_ISSUES.TXT
           and other docs.  Usually, these kinds of issues occur when there
           are conflicts with other desktop environments.  Backing up and
           moving certain directories in the user's $HOME (such as
           $HOME/.cache, $HOME/.config, and $HOME/.local) usually solves these
           issues.</li>
           <li>Q: How long does it take to build the packages?</li>
           <li>A: All the /deps, /base and /extra packages should not take too much time to build
           on any reasonably modern machine.</li>
           <li>Q: Who is behind MATE SlackBuilds?</li>
           <li>A: Willy Sudiarto Raharjo and Chess Griffin (Inactive).  Please post
           bug reports at the Github repo or send us an email at
           mateslackbuilds@gmail.com</li>
	   <li>Q: Are there any IRC support for MSB Project?</li>
	   <li>A: Yes, we have created #msb channel on freenode network.</li>
	   <li>Q: Does this site have a backup?</li>
	   <li>A: This site's source code is hosted at GitHub and we also have secondary domain
	   at <a href="https://mateslackbuilds.netlify.app">https://mateslackbuilds.netlify.app/</a>.
	   Thanks to <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> for providing us with Pro tier.</li>
